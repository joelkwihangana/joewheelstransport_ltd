Middleware functions can perform various tasks, such as logging, authentication, parsing request bodies, etc.\r\napp.use(): This method is used to mount middleware functions in the Express application. It takes a path and one or more middleware functions as arguments. When a request is made to the server, Express will match the request path with the path specified in app.use() and execute the middleware functions associated with that path.",
